            <h1>High Concept Statement</h1>
                <p>Voyager is an Role Playing Game where the player manages a spaceship(interactivity) and travels across the galaxy in search of 
                    a habitable planet for humanity(motivation). Due to negligence of humans , earth is close to  being inhabitable and was forced 
                    move to Mars and others space outposts(setting).
                </p>
                <p> (story)A spaceship of unknown orgin has been was found on Mars which seems to be of unknown orgin but somehwat similar to to human technology 
                    and a number 3017 engraved on it. A cordinate is also set on the spaceship which on examining shows a potentially habitable planet.
                    The ship fuel seems to replenish over time and seems to be designed for deep space exploration(core mechanic) along with probes to 
                    mine asteroid for resources and to explore planets.Oh did I mention there is also an AI on board. 
                </p>
                <p> Save the world from extinction by diving into deep space and explore the mysteries and the orgin of the spaceship 
                    and the adventures faced buy the crew. The game is inspired by the game Mass Effect and movie Interstellar. Similar audience 
                    will like the game with emphasis on a compelling story narration through humour and gameplay.

            <h1>COMPETITION</h1>
            <p>
                Taking inpiration form Mass effect and other spcae sci-fi themed movies, series and games will help in order to 
                create a familiarity with the players. Currently there are some games of similar mechanics and gameplay but the 
                game makes up for it by having a unique story line and mechanics different from the other games. 
                Mass effect is made for PC and console level so a minimilastic approch to the game is utilized.
