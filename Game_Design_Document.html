        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The game idea was inspired from countless sci-fi games, movies and series that I have grown up with . The game is basically a pet project that i want to do, i am fairly new to making games but love playing and making them so. The game is for those people like me who like sci-fi games and some weird story to the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hope the project will grow to a much larger audience that orginally intended.
                    This seems like a big project to take at first but like Tony Stark says "sometimes
                    you got to run before you walk".

    <p>
        The game is set in outer space, which the player navigates with the help of a spaceship. The player can explore the other planets, moons and asteroid. As the game progresses there will be planets that show sign of existence of alien life form which.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Moons</li>
            <dl>Usually devoid of life and players can explore it for resources and other materials that will be needed and some even has some human outposts where you can trade with them go on mission and have some unique interaction s with them. Each planet has a unique mystery for you to investigate and solve.
            </dl>
        <li>Asteroids</li>
        <dl>great source of raw materials for the player. Some may contain unique items or rare elements that will greatly help the player. You can also sell resources for in game currency to miners.
        </dl>
        <li>Planets</li>
        <dl>Finding habitable planets will help humans to move to and settle thereby ensuring survival. This will be the main aim of the game but some plants will harbor some mystery to it. Setting up a settlement will greatly boost the resources available to the player. Each planet will provide some kind of unique perk to the player that will be useful and sometimes necessary to go forward with the missions.

    <h1 class="text-info" id="Implimentaion">IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game Engine to be used is Unity as it is free and is very capable of producing the game relatively easily with the adequate knowledge and expertise. Moreover there is also a great community for the game engine that will prove useful to making the game through forums and clearing any bugs , fixes and also suggestions. Unity also provides some of the assets that will be used in the game so it will speed up development time too.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Audio and Sounds will be taken from open non-copyrighted sources and if there is budget some unique ones may be licensed from artists too. Sound effects for a space game are numerous and will be easy to obtain .Unique voice actors may be used for the game or just a text based communication will be used if it proves to be too much of a hassle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game engine will need to be optimized to run in game .Taking notes from similar games that have ventured into this territory will prove useful and the core concepts could be used for making the game more easily.
                <li>
                    Characters and other assets needed can be brought from the asset store or hire people to make some models to be used in the game based on the estimated budgets some character and features may be added or removed.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h1 class="text-info" id="Concept">CONCEPT</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> The ship would look something like this but the graphics will be significantly toned down as the game is designed for a mobile platform </li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux5qtP2mMPQQeSinpHYZK9-970-80.png" alt="space ship image">
                <li>Would be cool to build a game that looks remotely close to this though 

                </li>
            </ul>

    <h1 class="text-info" id="Aesthetics">AESTHETICS</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall game design is aimed to invoke a feeling of a hero behavior in the player. To save humanity from its actions and the natural order of destruction and entropy</li>
                <li>The Visual will be made immersive to engage the player and to make them absorb the game world and the unique art style of the game. A relatable calm and catchfly background music similar to mine craft songs will be implemented in the game that will increase the overall user experience of the game and get a much rich experience for the player and to accurately communicate the story of the game.</li>
                 <li>The player will need to learn to manage the ships, the crew and also control the settlements with the help of the AI that will provide some suggestion and statistics but the end result will be direct consequence of the player action good or bad. The player will also need to make thought choices regarding the state of settlers and the crew.</li>

            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li>The game involves controlling ship with directional control in a 2D top down with option to switch the camera few to a first person for a much more immersive experience to the player and style to navigate to different planets, moons and asteroids</li>
                    <li>Player can move within the ship as a human avatar and interact with different parts of the ship</li>
                    <li>The fuel of the ship is self replenishing by harnessing a mysterious source of energy that the AI claims to have corrupted data , this will place a time constrain on the player to switch between moving the ship and controlling character within the ship</li>
                    <li>The resources are taken into account based on real life elemental requirements for current technology and also some sci-fi elements the AI came up with</li>
                    <li>Player can also micromanage the movement of the home world settlers to different planets which will help to generate a passive income for the player to upgrade the ship and other expand forward</li>
                    <li>A fighting emend of the game will be completely optional as there will be chances to avoid conflict but if you choose to take violent action then there will be repercussions but sometimes it will be a necessary evil.</li>
                    <li>The micro management of the game will be a level based system unlocking new skills with increase in levels and allotting skill points to various attributes of the player, ship, crew and the home world. Choose your path on how to save the world or if you are not so valiant you can even watch the world literally watch it burn , the sun is like going to turn into a red giant soon.</li>
